/*
âœ… Purpose of Abstract Factory Pattern

    - To provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
      without specifying their concrete classes.
    - Useful when the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
    - Promotes consistency among products in a family (e.g., UI components for different themes or OSes).
    - Encourages scalability and follows the Open/Closed Principle by allowing easy extension of product families.
