/*
    âœ… Purpose of Command Pattern
    - To encapsulate a request as an object, thereby decoupling sender and receiver.
    - Allows logging, queuing, and undoing of operations.
    - Promotes loose coupling and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.
    - Ideal for scenarios like remote controls, task scheduling, and transactional operations.

    - Command design pattern divide logic in three parts -> receiver, invoker and command
    Client invoke and invoker generated command and command is received by receiver
