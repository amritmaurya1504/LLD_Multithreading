/*
âœ… Purpose of Factory Method
    - To encapsulate object creation logic.
    - Allows subclasses or factory classes to decide which class to instantiate.
    - Promotes loose coupling and follows the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

    Why not good :
    - Every time a new developer role is added (e.g., MLDeveloper),
      you must modify the factory, violating Open/Closed Principle.
