/*
âœ… Purpose of Singleton Pattern
    - Ensure only one instance of a class is created during the application's lifetime.
    - Provides a global access point to that single instance.
    - Useful for shared resources like configuration, logging, cache, thread pools, etc.
    - Helps control resource usage and maintain consistent state across threads.
